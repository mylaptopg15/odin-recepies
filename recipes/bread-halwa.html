            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Milk</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take 4 bread slices cut them into small cubes and set it aside. You can add with edges or remove them. I add it these days as it makes no major difference in taste.</li>
            <li>To a pan add 2 tablespoon ghee then 3 tablespoon cashews broken. Fry until golden brown, remove and set aside. In total we need 1/3 cup ghee but we add it little by little.</li>
            <li>Now add the bread cubes.</li>
            <li>Fry the bread cubes until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add 1 and 1/2 cups boiled milk.</li>
            <li>Mash and cook for 2-3 minutes. Bread does not take much time to cook.</li>
            <li>Once cooked add 1/3 cup sugar.</li>
            <li>Mix well and the mixture turns goey like this. Keep stirring and cooking for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add little more ghee along with 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>Cook until the halwa starts to leave the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Now add remaining ghee.</li>
            <li>Give a quick mix.</li>
            <li>Add Ghee fried cashews.</li>
            <li>Bread halwa is ready.</li>
            <li>When you take the bread halwa with a spoon or ladle it should fall off easily without sticking. This is the perfect consistency.</li>
        </ol>
